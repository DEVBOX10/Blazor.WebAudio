# Blazor.WebAudio
A Blazor wrapper for the [Web Audio browser API.](https://www.w3.org/TR/webaudio/)
This Web API standardizes methods for processing and synthesizing audio in web applications. The primary paradigm is of an audio routing graph, where a number of AudioNode objects are connected together to define the overall audio rendering. This project implements a wrapper around the API for Blazor so that we can easily and safely work with audio in the browser.

**This wrapper is still being developed so ideas are still being tested and experimented with.**

## Research
The preliminary analysis of what is needed to wrap this has begun and will be collected in this section before the real work begins.
